  abstract = {In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a ‘cobordism’: a manifold representing spacetime, going between two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on topological quantum field theory and ‘quantum topology’. But this was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of ‘closed symmetric monoidal category’. We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive introduction to spacetime algebra that emphasizes its practicality and power as a tool for the study of electromagnetism. We carefully develop this natural (Clifford) algebra of the Minkowski spacetime geometry, with a particular focus on its intrinsic (and often overlooked) complex structure. Notably, the scalar imaginary that appears throughout the electromagnetic theory properly corresponds to the unit 4-volume of spacetime itself, and thus has physical meaning. The electric and magnetic fields are combined into a single complex and frame-independent bivector field, which generalizes the Riemann-Silberstein complex vector that has recently resurfaced in studies of the single photon wavefunction. The complex structure of spacetime also underpins the emergence of electromagnetic waves, circular polarizations, the normal variables for canonical quantization, the distinction between electric and magnetic charge, complex spinor representations of Lorentz transformations, and the dual (electric-magnetic field exchange) symmetry that produces helicity conservation in vacuum fields. This latter symmetry manifests as an arbitrary global phase of the complex field, motivating the use of a complex vector potential, along with an associated transverse and gauge-invariant bivector potential, as well as complex (bivector and scalar) Hertz potentials. Our detailed treatment aims to encourage the use of spacetime algebra as a readily available and mature extension to existing vector calculus and tensor methods that can greatly simplify the analysis of fundamentally relativistic objects like the electromagnetic field.},

Striving for clarity, we shift our focus to lenses as abstractions for bidirectional programming. By means of standard mathematical terminology as well as intuitive properties of bidirectional programs, we observe different ways to characterize lenses and show exactly how their laws interact. Like proper adjustment of optical lenses is essential for taking clear pictures, proper organization of lens laws is essential for forming a clear picture of different lens classes. Incidentally, the process of understanding bidirectional lenses clearly is quite similar to the process of taking a good picture.},

The group Spin(n), called a spinor group, is defined as a certain subgroup of units of an algebra, Cl\_n, the Clifford algebra associated with reals\textasciicircum n. Since the spinor groups are certain well chosen subgroups of units of Clifford algebras, it is necessary to investigate Clifford algebras to get a firm understanding of spinor groups. These notes provide a tutorial on Clifford algebra and the groups Spin and Pin, including a study of the structure of the Clifford algebra Cl\_\{p, q\} associated with a nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form of signature (p, q) and culminating in the beautiful "8-periodicity theorem" of Elie Cartan and Raoul Bott (with proofs).},

This computational model lends itself naturally to the diagrammatic language of ZXCalculus, a perspective not exploited in the original discussions. Independently, percolation methods have been used to decipher phase transitions in the computational efficiencies of resources. Whilst both percolation theory and the ZX language carry evident relations to graph theory, their symbiosis is yet to be exploited in simultaneity. We hope to promote a bridging of these two perspectives, demonstrating a natural duality for tackling faulty measurement-based systems.},

The operator-overloading approach to performing reverse-mode automatic differentiation is the most convenient for the user but current implementations are typically 10-35 times slower than the original algorithm. In this paper a fast new operator-overloading method is presented that uses the               expression template               programming technique in C++ to provide a compile-time representation of each mathematical expression as a computational graph that can be efficiently traversed in either direction. Benchmarking with four different numerical algorithms shows this approach to be 2.6--9 times faster than current operator-overloading libraries, and 1.3--7.7 times more efficient in memory usage. It is typically less than 4 times the computational cost of the original algorithm, although poorer performance is found for all libraries in the case of simple loops containing no mathematical functions. An implementation is freely available in the               Adept               C++ software library.},

For example, one type responds best to a dark, convex form moving centripetally (a fly). Here we consider a complementary question: how much information does the retina send and how is it apportioned among different cell types? Recording from guinea pig retina on a multi-electrode array and presenting various types of motion in natural scenes, we measured information rates for seven types of ganglion cell. Mean rates varied across cell types (6–13 bits · s−1) more than across stimuli. Sluggish cells transmitted information at lower rates than brisk cells, but because of trade-offs between noise and temporal correlation, all types had the same coding efficiency. Calculating the proportions of each cell type from receptive field size and coverage factor, we conclude (assuming independence) that the approximately 105 ganglion cells transmit on the order of 875,000 bits · s−1. Because sluggish cells are equally efficient but more numerous, they account for most of the information. With approximately 106 ganglion cells, the human retina would transmit data at roughly the rate of an Ethernet connection.},

The technique we use to analyse the three-dimensional transformations involved will be that of geometric algebra: a framework based on the algebras of Clifford and Grassmann. This is not a system designed specifically for the task in hand, but rather a framework for all mathematical physics. Central to the power of this approach is the way in which the formalism deals with rotations; for example, if we have two arbitrary sets of vectors, known to be related via a 3D rotation, the rotation is easily recoverable if the vectors are given. Extracting the rotation by conventional means is not as straightforward. The calculus associated with geometric algebra is particularly powerful, enabling one, in a very natural way, to take derivatives with respect to any multivector (general element of the algebra). What this means in practice is that we can minimize with respect to rotors representing rotations, vectors representing translations, or any other relevant geometric quantity. This has important implications for many of the least-squares problems in computer vision where one attempts to find optimal rotations, translations etc., given observed vector quantities. We will illustrate this by analysing the problem of estimating motion from a pair of images, looking particularly at the more difficult case in which we have available only 2D information and no information on range. While this problem has already been much discussed in the literature, we believe the present formulation to be the only one in which least-squares estimates of the motion and structure are derived simultaneously using analytic derivatives.},

One very common example is finding a rotor or orthogonal matrix representing rotation, given knowledge of initial and transformed points.                                         In this paper, we discuss methods in the literature for recovering such rotors and then outline a GA method, which generalises to cases of any signature and any dimension, and which is not restricted to orthonormal sets of vectors. The proof of this technique is both concise and elegant and uses the concept of               characteristic multivectors               as discussed in the book by Hestenes and Sobczyk, which contains a treatment of linear algebra using geometric algebra. Expressing orthogonal transformations as rotors, enables us to create               fractional transformations               and we discuss this for some classic transforms. In real applications, our initial and/or final sets of vectors will be noisy. We show how to use the characteristic multivector method to find a ‘best fit’ rotor between these sets and compare our results with other methods.},

  abstract = {Computing derivatives of tensor expressions, also known as tensor calculus, is a fundamental task in machine learning. A key concern is the efficiency of evaluating the expressions and their derivatives that hinges on the representation of these expressions. Recently, an algorithm for computing higher order derivatives of tensor expressions like Jacobians or Hessians has been introduced that is a few orders of magnitude faster than previous state-of-the-art approaches. Unfortunately, the approach is based on Ricci notation and hence cannot be incorporated into automatic differentiation frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, autograd, or JAX that use the simpler Einstein notation. This leaves two options, to either change the underlying tensor representation in these frameworks or to develop a new, provably correct algorithm based on Einstein notation. Obviously, the first option is impractical. Hence, we pursue the second option. Here, we show that using Ricci notation is not necessary for an efficient tensor calculus and develop an equally efficient method for the simpler Einstein notation. It turns out that turning to Einstein notation enables further improvements that lead to even better efficiency.},

  abstract = {Mit Hilfe der Technik des Automatischen Differenzierens (AD) lassen sich für Funktionen, die als Programmquellcode gegeben sind, Ableitungsinformationen rechentechnisch effizient und mit geringem Aufwand für den Nutzer bereitstellen. Eine Variante der Implementierung von AD basiert auf der Überladung von Operatoren und Funktionen, die von vielen modernen Programmiersprachen ermöglicht wird. Durch Ausnutzung des Konzepts der Überladung wird eine interne Funktions-Repräsentation (Tape) generiert, die anschließend für die Ableitungsberechnung herangezogen wird. In der Dissertation werden neue Techniken erarbeitet, die eine effizientere Tape-Erstellung und die parallele Tape-Auswertung ermöglichen. Anhand von Laufzeituntersuchungen für numerische Beispiele werden die Möglichkeiten der neuen Techniken verdeutlicht.Using the technique of Automatic Differentiation (AD), derivative information can be computed efficiently for any function that is given as source code in a supported programming languages. One basic implementation strategy is based on the concept of operator overloading that is available for many programming languages. Due the overloading of operators, an internal representation of the function can be generated at runtime. This so-called tape can then be used for computing derivatives. In the thesis, new techniques are introduced that allow a more efficient tape creation and the parallel evaluation of tapes. Advantages of the new techniques are demonstrated by means of runtime analyses for numerical examples},

  abstract = {Many problems in computer vision today are solved via deep learning. Tasks like pose estimation from images, pose estimation from point clouds or structure from motion can all be formulated as a regression on rotations. However, there is no unique way of parametrizing rotations mathematically: matrices, quaternions, axis-angle representation or Euler angles are all commonly used in the field. Some of them, however, present intrinsic limitations, including discontinuities, gimbal lock or antipodal symmetry. These limitations may make the learning of rotations via neural networks a challenging problem, potentially introducing large errors. Following recent literature, we propose three case studies: a sanity check, a pose estimation from 3D point clouds and an inverse kinematic problem. We do so by employing a full geometric algebra (GA) description of rotations. We compare the GA formulation with a 6D continuous representation previously presented in the literature in terms of regression error and reconstruction accuracy. We empirically demonstrate that parametrizing rotations as bivectors outperforms the 6D representation. The GA approach overcomes the continuity issue of representations as the 6D representation does, but it also needs fewer parameters to be learned and offers an enhanced robustness to noise. GA hence provides a broader framework for describing rotations in a simple and compact way that is suitable for regression tasks via deep learning, showing high regression accuracy and good generalizability in realistic high-noise scenarios.},

We first review the quintessence of modern (plane-based) geometric algebra, which builds on isometries encoded as elements of the \$\textbackslash mathrm\{Pin\}(p,q,r)\$ group. We then propose the concept of group action layers, which linearly combine object transformations using pre-specified group actions. Together with a new activation and normalization scheme, these layers serve as adjustable \$\textbackslash textit\{geometric templates\}\$ that can be refined via gradient descent. Theoretical advantages are strongly reflected in the modeling of three-dimensional rigid body transformations as well as large-scale fluid dynamics simulations, showing significantly improved performance over traditional methods.},

Domestication was not only an epochal break in human history, but it also made possible new modes of social transformation.},

Geometric algebra (or real Clifford algebra) serves as an efficient language for describing rotations in vector spaces of arbitrary metric signature, including Lorentzian spacetime. By adopting the rotor formalism of geometric algebra, we derive an explicit BCHD formula for composing Lorentz transformations in terms of their generators — much more easily than with traditional matrix representations. This is used to straightforwardly derive the composition law for Lorentz boosts and the concomitant Wigner angle. Later, we include a gentle introduction to differential geometry, noting how the Lie derivative and covariant derivative assume compact forms when expressed with geometric algebra. Curvature is studied as an obstruction to the integrability of the parallel transport equations, and we present a surface-ordered Stokes’ theorem relating the ‘enclosed curvature’ in a surface to the holonomy around its boundary.},
